  - [x] main map
- [ ] Deploy app (2+ hours)
  - [ ] make sure API keys are secure 
    - [x] spotify
    - [ ] google maps - need to secure from google cloud console 
  - [x] heroku for app files
  - [x] db cloud hosting 
  - [x] create separate dev/production environments
- [ ] Create project README (4 hours)
  - [ ] Application architecture diagram
  - [ ] Screencasts of app turned into GIFs
- [ ] BUG: when use searches on about page, it doesn't redirect to main page (although the search is processed correctly). should be a straightforward redirect 

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] fuzzy search results (if there's a good library it should be quick)
- [ ] Data visualization page (whole day)
  - [ ] Use Google Data Studio API to create 4 basic maps and charts (or possibly other API). state-to-state comparison, regional comparison
  - [ ] **super strech** integrate additional third party APIs to get further data (billboard, etc.)
- [ ] database stuff
  - [ ] add route for get 1 rapper (actually not nec, but shouldn't be hard..could be useful later)
- [ ] Update site visual language 
  - [ ] better icon
  - [ ] customize colors/fonts 
  - [ ] make everything dark mode 
- [ ] Add routes for infobox/modals (not sure if desirable) (2+ hours)
- [ ] Add rapper functionality (whole day)
  - [ ] form where user can add rapper
    - [ ] MUST include coordinates via Google Maps API
  - [ ] backend updates data with new rapper (pending review and confirmation)
- [ ] Bug fixes
  - [ ] when you click on more info and button over a rapper pin it says there was a problem w the DB
  - [ ] when you make the more info popup go small to big again, it doesn't resize properly
    - [ ] i think this could probably be fixed with a separate class for each, instead of the current 1 class plus media query
